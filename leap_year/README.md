# Leap year challenge

Given a year, report if it is a leap year.

Write a function that recevives one parameter year and return true if the year is a leap year or false if not.

A leap year is:
    every year that is evenly divisible by 4
        except every year that is evenly divisible by 100
            unless the year is also evenly divisible by 400

For example, 1997 is not a leap year, but 1996 is. 1900 is not a leap year, but 2000 is.
